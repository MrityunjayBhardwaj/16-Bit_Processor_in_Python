1. PreProcess the file
    *remove the white spaces and comments

2. Initialize the Symbol table
    *Construct and Add predefined Symbols in symbol table

3. First Pass Processing
    *Trace the lines and find the "(Label)" symbol
    *Add the Label in Symbol table along with the line address next to it.
    *and then remove all the Label defination

4. Second Pass:
    NOTE: the variable address starts from RAM[16] because R0-R15 are researved symbols according to specification.
    Set n = 16

   *Trace the program line by line if we encounter @symbol:
        search that symbol inside Symbol table
            {if we found it inside. then,replace this symbol to its corresponding value.}
            {if not, then append this symbol inside Symbol table along with value = n 
            (increment the value)n++}
        
5. Translate all the decimal symbols to binary

6. if the instruction is C then translate the program using the specification table.


then finally write the translation to the  Binarry instruction file in order to feed it to our Mechine!!! for processing
